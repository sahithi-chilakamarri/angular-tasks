In this scenario, create three components, say component1, component2, and component3. Component1 is a parent of component2, and component2 is a parent of component3. A user should be able to enter text in the .html template file of component3. The template of component1 (grandparent) should display the text. Create the task in a scenario5 folder of your project. All files of the components should be inside the scenario5 folder.
